# Project:"Developed a Regression -Based Predictive Model for Housing Price Estimation"
# Description
This project involves predicting house prices in Boston using machine learning. The Boston Housing Dataset contains various features such as crime rates, average number of rooms, proximity to employment centers, and more. These features are used to predict the median value of homes, which is the target variable.

The project leverages several machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to build predictive models. The goal is to evaluate and compare these models based on performance metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to determine the most effective model for predicting housing prices.
# Key Steps:
Data Preprocessing: Clean the data, handle missing values, and scale the features.
Model Training: Train multiple models to predict house prices.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate and compare the models based on performance metrics.
This project provides insights into how machine learning can be applied to real-world problems, such as predicting house prices, and demonstrates the effectiveness of different algorithms for regression tasks.

# Conclusion
The Boston Housing Price Prediction project successfully applied machine learning algorithms to predict housing prices based on various factors. Through experimentation with different models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, we found that tree-based models such as Random Forest and XGBoost delivered superior performance in comparison to Linear Regression.

These results demonstrate the potential of machine learning in predictive analytics, and the ability of more complex models to capture non-linear relationships in the data. Additionally, we observed that feature selection and tuning hyperparameters could further improve model accuracy.

Overall, this project highlights the value of machine learning in understanding complex datasets and making predictions, while also providing a foundation for further model optimization and real-world applications.
